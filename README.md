# HTTPNetworkingStarterProject

just some starter apps I made to refresh my memory on http and networking concepts:)

# project description
3 in 1 project, all doing HTTP get responses and printing out headers, body, status code, etc, but using different APIs and languages (Swift, Objective C, C++)

# key phrases learned
PlaygroundPage.current.needsIndefiniteExecution = true 
Prevents playground from quitting too early

Create shared task
perform network requests (like GET or POST) asynchronously in Swift.

key: The header name (e.g. "Content-Type", "Date", "Server")
value: The header value (e.g. "application/json", "Mon, 27 May 2025 10:00:00 GMT")

converts raw byte data into a readable string

line is used to stop the main run loop in a macOS or iOS application, usually in non-UI contexts like command-line tools or unit tests.

What does task resume do?
It starts the network task if it hasnâ€™t started yet.
Or resumes the task if it was previously suspended.
Without calling resume, the task will not start and no network request happens.

An autorelease pool is a mechanism used in Objective-C to manage the memory of objects that are sent an autoreleasemessage. It helps automatically release objects at a later time, avoiding memory leaks without requiring you to manually release every object immediately.
